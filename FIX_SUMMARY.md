# Slack Bot Fix Summary

## Problem
The Slack bot was failing to handle slash commands because it was trying to parse form-encoded data as JSON. The error logs showed:

```
Failed to parse JSON: 415 Unsupported Media Type: Did not attempt to load JSON data because the request Content-Type was not 'application/json'.
```

## Root Cause
Slack sends different types of requests with different content types:
- **Slash commands**: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- **Events & Interactive components**: `application/json`

The original code in `/slack/events` route was trying to parse all requests as JSON using `request.get_json()`, which fails for form-encoded data.

## Solution
Modified the `/slack/events` route in `slack_bot.py` to:

1. **Detect content type** from the request headers
2. **Handle JSON requests** (events, interactive components) with `request.get_json()`
3. **Handle form-encoded requests** (slash commands) by passing them directly to the Slack Bolt handler
4. **Gracefully handle unexpected content types** by trying the handler anyway

## Code Changes
```python
# Before (lines 698-748 in slack_bot.py)
try:
    request_data = request.get_json()  # This fails for form-encoded data
    # ... rest of JSON handling
except Exception as json_error:
    return {"error": "Invalid JSON"}, 400

# After
content_type = request.headers.get('Content-Type', '')
if 'application/json' in content_type:
    # Handle JSON requests
    request_data = request.get_json()
    # ... JSON handling
elif 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' in content_type:
    # Handle form-encoded requests (slash commands)
    return handler.handle(request)
else:
    # Try to handle anyway
    return handler.handle(request)
```

## Testing
The fix should now properly handle:
- ✅ Slash commands (`/tellboss`, `/tldr`, `/befr`, `/clear`)
- ✅ Interactive components (button clicks)
- ✅ Slack events
- ✅ URL verification challenges

## Deployment
The fix is ready for deployment. The bot should now respond correctly to slash commands from Slack.
